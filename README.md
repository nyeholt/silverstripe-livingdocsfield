# LivingDocs for SilverStripe

This is a first draft of a LivingDocs Field for SilverStripe. It basically contains no functionality.

See it on video here: [https://vimeo.com/122740856](https://vimeo.com/122740856).

## What it does

Currently the field is displaying some default content from Living Docs. Upon pressing the save button, 
the content of the field is written as HTML to a hidden textarea field which is then saved in the DB.
To open the Editor again, the content is also saved as JSON serialization in the Content_raw field.

## Support

Please help with developing this form field. I hope the video of the demo showed enough to
convince everyone that it's a worthwile endeavour.
